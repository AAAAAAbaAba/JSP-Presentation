A web demo system to present solving basic Job Shop Schedule Problem by different algorithms or solvers.
It uses a third pard UI component in GPL license to show schedule results([angular-gantt-schedule-timeline-calendar](https://github.com/neuronetio/angular-gantt-schedule-timeline-calendar)), so it must also be in GPL.

# About this project
It's a personal demo project to display the process and result of solving JSP problem by different representation model or algorithms.I create it out of interest in JSP problem, I was responsible for algorithm module development in a production schedule project before, though I can evaluate one algorithm's or solver's performance by comparing objective score and calculating time, it's hard to watch the whole calculating process intuitively without web UI, and which is
